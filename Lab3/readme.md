## Executive Summary 
In this lab I will be exoloring computer software for general computing and enterprise initiatives
as well as explaining a vareity of terms that share relevance to virtualization, pyhton and careers in computing

## Software
### Types of Software
Application software, often referred to as productivity programs or end-user programs because they enable the user to complete tasks, such as creating a spreadsheet.
Ultilty software enables you to fix and/or modify your computer system through various programs, for example malware protection software.
Operating systems software mostly gives developers the opportunity in which they are able to write, test as well as compile their coding, for example the Linux operating system.
### ERP
The sole purpose of ERP software is to assist in bringing a corporation together under one program to avoid miscommunication.
## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
A commom problem solved by virtualization is a lack of server back up. Virtualization can make for an easy and a simplistc way to back up servers.
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors in virtualization are used to provide an abstraction layer to separate the virtual machines from the system hardware.

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
The Python pseudocode does not involve any code in it. The Python pseudocode must be a very close representation of the algorithmic logic.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
The difference between the two is a compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters. An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely.
## Career Exploration
### Handshake
This was a fun excerise it opened my eyes to many different possibilities, I was most surprised by the management and data engineer positions.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I found that more postions within IT/CS make a very comfortable living as well as that there is substantial growth for these occupations.
### Certifications
I've learned a decent amount on just how many possible certificates are out there, especially job/company specific ones.
### Certificates and Degrees
A degree, certificate and professional development are all features of cybersecurity.
### Co-ops / Internships
You can Gain practical work experience in areas that complement your personal strengths, interests and educational needs.
Discover new personal strengths and skills and thrive as a responsible team member in the real world in an area that you choose.
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
I would most likely beneift from a cybersecurity club because of its relevance to my area of study.
## Conclusion
In todayâ€™s lab I went over many different terms that tie into programming and coding. I went further on into the lab to define various softwares as well.
Most importantly I navigated through a couple different sites that gave me a better understanding of what could be doing to further benefit myself such as career paths and club. I also find more out about my field of study with added details that had to do with certain certifcates. I thoroughly enjoyed this lab and learned much from it.
