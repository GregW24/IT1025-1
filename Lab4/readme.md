## Executive Summary 
Learning about operating systems and practice working at the command line of your operating system.    
Read up on additional software such as an interactive programming environment.

## Python IDLE
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter. However, in order to write a more complexed python program you need an editor. IDLE, on the other hand, has combined the above two needs and bundled them as a package.
## Code Examples
### Variable: Variables are containers for storing data values. (The variable names spam, eggs, and bacon are used as the three blocks for the coding examples)
### Assignment statement: These statements are used to assign objects to names. The target of an assignment statement is written on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the object on the right can be an arbitrary expression that computes an object.
### Function: Is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function can return data as a result.
### Three data types: Numeric, Sequence Type, Boolean.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics: Vector graphics are digital art that is rendered by a computer using a mathematical formula. Raster images are made up of tiny pixels, making them resolution dependent and best used for creating photos. Raster images are made of pixels, or tiny dots that use color and tone to produce the image.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression: The big benefit and advantage of lossless compression are that it allows you to retain the quality of your images while reducing their file size. You'll improve your site performance, and you won't affect your images' quality.
### File Formats: JPEG works best for storing full-color images full of complex shading and color variation. PNG is mostly superior to GIF, as it is newer, supports more colors, and is free of patent restrictions. PNG cannot be used for animation, but offers highly sophisticated transparency and color support, among other features.
### File Properties

## Conclusion

In this lesson, I was able to learn a lot about Python IDLE. I also enjoyed making my own codes and learning the different variations of them. I also enjoyed discovering the differences between Raster and Vector graphics. Lastly, throughout this lab I really enjoyed everything I was able to learn.
