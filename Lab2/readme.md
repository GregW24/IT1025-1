## Executive Summary 
In modules 1, 2 and 3 we learned about transfer rates between RAM, the difference of hard drives and solid state hard drives. Also different control units and how the CPU communicates with inputs and outputs. 

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
 Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, it is determined by the spindle speed. Hard drives transfer rate is determined by the speed of transfer to and from the media disk, it is measured in MBps. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Solid state hard drives are often compared to traditional hard disk drives. They work significantly better than hard disk drives because the entire goal of them is to have no moving parts to avoid errors. Solid state hard drives are also a lot quicker to use because hard disk drives must read the moving disk whereas the solid state hard drives can be processed at the speed of light. 
#### Random Access Memory
With more RAM a computer can processmore data quicker because it does not have to rely on the computer's motherboard and back up hard drive to process or use the information. DIMMS can transfer twice the amount of data at 64 nits versus simms at 32 bits at a time
### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU is responsible for all math equations. The control unit tells the ALU what needs to be solved and the ALU gives the output. 
### CPU, Input & Output
At a gas station you would insert your card and the cpu would process your information while you could enter your pin or zip code and then select the type of gasoline you need and the cpu reads that determining the output being the type of gas to output into your vehicle. 
### Logic Gates 
A truth table shows the output you will get for every possible input. For a AND gate both inputs must be the same to have the same output or else it will be 0. For the OR at least one of the inputs will match the output. These can be compared to the truth tables because there is a rule for each one to determine the outputs. 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The purpose of IEEE considers the code of eight principles related to the behavior of and decisions made by professionals such as software engineers and many other supervisors, policy makers, etc. The purpose of these principles is for engineers and professionals to act with these codes in mind. 
## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal is the equivalent of adding the given numbers together. Binary means 2 so it is each number raised to the 2 power. Hexadecimal means base of 16, has 16 numbers and bases of 16. 
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The numbers are the input value and the color is the output. 
## Conclusion
In conclusion I have a better understanding of inputs and outputs and how the CPU functions.
